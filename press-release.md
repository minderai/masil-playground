Consider adding a second quote or mention from a known industry figure or organization to further strengthen the section.
Contact Information:

Include specific contact details for press inquiries (email, phone, etc.) instead of placeholders like [Contact Information].
Media Kit and Links:

Replace placeholder links with real URLs to resources such as documentation, GitHub, or media assets.
Call to Developers:
