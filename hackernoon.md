## Minder AI Structured Interactive Language - A New Frontier Open Standard

Minder AI Structured Interactive Language (MASIL) can be thought of as a maestro conducting an orchestra of technologies with AI at the front of the stage.

My Company, SimplerTasks Company today announced the pre-release of MASIL (Minder AI Structured Interactive Language) as a fully open standard under the MIT license. This innovative specification is designed to revolutionize how developers and non-programmers interact with AI systems. This frontier structured language combines the simplicity of XML with powerful AI-centric features, setting a new foundation for AI application development.

MASIL is an innovative language that bridges the gap between human intent and AI capabilities and existing web technologies. It makes it possible for both developers and non-programmers to create sophisticated AI applications without licensing restrictions.

> I've always wondered, why aren't we already using something like this? Why didn't we start with this type of structure? I see nothing like it on the Internet today.

## A ChatGPT Candid Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

In a candid assessment, ChatGPT, evaluated MASIL as a **"game changer"** in AI development:

> "MASIL is a game changer because it addresses a foundational gap in how AI systems handle workflows and human interactions. The introduction of a structured, extensible language like MASIL solves one of the most persistent problems in AI: the lack of predictability and consistency in outcomes. By bridging the gap between natural language chaos and machine precision, MASIL provides a framework that is both accessible to non-programmers and powerful enough for developers.

Perhaps a mere hallucination of some sort or a valid prediction, only time will tell. I've never believed in the old saying, "if you build it, they will come". There seems to be a lot more to it than just building.

I was also encouraged that both Claude and Gemini agreed but were not quite as optimistic.

## What is MASIL?

MASIL (Minder AI Structured Interactive Language) is an XML-based markup language designed to facilitate structured interactions between AI systems, web interfaces, and data components. It provides a standardized way to define AI behaviors, manage data, and handle web presentation layers while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

## Key Features

- Open Standard: Free for everyone to use and modify under the MIT license.

- Super Prompts: A structured approach to controlling AI interactions. More on this below!

- Component-First Architecture: Modular design for reusable workflows.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works with existing web technologies.

## Why MASIL Matters

Building AI apps can be chaotic. MASIL brings order by:

- Simplifying complex AI workflows.

- Making AI interactions more predictable.

- Bridging the gap between natural language and machine precision.

## Super Prompts: MASIL's Special Sauce

Super Prompts let you define precise inputs and outputs for AI interactions, improving reliability and predictability. The MASIL document can be copied and pasted into most AIs, which will understand the structure and act accordingly. These interactions can then be round tripped back into the MASIL file. This capability is a natural feature of MASIL and can be used today.

## MASIL: A Two-Part Approach

The MASIL standard has two parts:

1.  A strict XML-compliant XSD schema for defining data and workflows.

2.  A relaxed schema, not XML, with the ability to address AI with natural language. This means authors can use natural language, a structured approach, or a combination of both.

## Offloading Processing to JavaScript

MASIL offloads processing from the AI engine to JavaScript, leveraging the strengths of both technologies. A simple demonstration of this is the graphing capabilities in the playground on glitch.com. The data can be manipulated by AI, pasted into the MASIL file, and JavaScript can do the heavy lifting for graphing or anything else that JavaScript is good at. Why burden AI processing with things best done locally? This also offers the potential for enhanced privacy.

## A Playground for Experimentation

I've put two files on Glitch.com: 'index.html' and the MASIL file. You can play with them to see how MASIL works in practice. This is a proof of concept and not a complete demonstration, but it allows you to experiment with a pre-release version of MASIL today.

## The Evolution of MASIL

My year-long journey to arrive at the MASIL standard has a bit of history. A year ago, AI wasn't ready for MASIL, but things have changed! MASIL has gone through several iterations:

1.  AI Markdown (aimarkdown.org): My first attempt at structuring AI workflows.

2.  AI DataDoc: An intermediate stage in the development. You can read more about AI DataDoc in my Hacker Noon article: [https://hackernoon.com/aidatadoc-chatgpt-web-technologies-one-file-to-rule-them-all-open-source-simple-portable](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://hackernoon.com/aidatadoc-chatgpt-web-technologies-one-file-to-rule-them-all-open-source-simple-portable).

3.  MinderAI's MASIL: The current, fully-realized format.

## A Standard You Can Use Today

MASIL is ready to be used now. It's XML-compliant, making it adaptable to various AI systems. While you might need to 'convince' AI that MASIL is a standard, its structure makes it easy to work with.

## The Future of MASIL

This is a pre-release of the standard. I envision MASIL being develope with frameworks like Svelte or React with direct access to AI through API's. MASIL would be at the core, , but the copy And Pastings method would not only be required as it is not ideal. This would allow for seamless incorporation of AI large language models and more streamlined workflows.

## A Frontier Standard

MASIL is a foundational element in the evolving landscape of AI development. It's a 'frontier standard' that addresses the need for structure and predictability in AI workflows.

## Call to Action

MASIL is an evolving standard, and I welcome your feedback! Check out the pre-release, experiment with it, and share your thoughts. Let's shape the future of AI development together!

**P.S.** Adoption of the MASIL standard by large language models would be a huge step forward for AI development. Let's make it happen!

## Disclaimer

At age 71, I could not have created and tested MASIL without the help of Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT. My biggest contribution was probably trying to keep things simple and explain my hopes to a AI that was unfamiliar with a proposed standard.
