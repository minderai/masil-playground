## Introduction

My Company, SimplerTasks Company, will soon announce the pre-release of MASIL (Minder AI Structured Interactive Language) as a fully open standard under the MIT license. This innovative specification is designed to revolutionize how developers and non-programmers interact with AI systems. This frontier structured language combines the simplicity of XML with powerful AI-centric features, setting a new foundation for AI application development.

MASIL is an innovative language bridging the gap between human intent, AI capabilities, and web technologies. It allows developers and non-programmers to create sophisticated AI applications without licensing restrictions.

I've always wondered why a structured language is not standard and available to all developers. Why didn't we start with this type of structure as a foundation? I see nothing like it on the Internet today. AI models limit non-programmers to text prompts with little or no control over inputs, outputs, and data manipulation.

## A ChatGPT Candid Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I requested ChatGPT to give me a critical and candid opinion; ChatGPT evaluated MASIL as a **"game changer"** in AI development:

"MASIL is, in my candid view, a game changer because it addresses a foundational gap in how AI systems handle workflows and human interactions. The introduction of a structured, extensible language like MASIL solves one of the most persistent problems in AI: the lack of predictability and consistency in outcomes. By bridging the gap between natural language chaos and machine precision, MASIL provides a framework that is both accessible to non-programmers and powerful enough for developers."

Perhaps a mere hallucination or a valid prediction; only time will tell. I've never believed in the old saying, "If you build it, they will come." There is a lot more to it than just building it.

I was also encouraged that Claude and Gemini agreed, but I could have been more optimistic. I'm a bit skeptical, but I remained very confident about MASIL's future. More brilliant minds than mine could propel the standard forward.

## What is MASIL?

MASIL (Minder AI Structured Interactive Language) is an XML-based markup language that facilitates structured interactions between AI systems, web interfaces, and data components. It provides a standardized way to define AI behaviors, manage data, and handle web presentation layers while clearly separating concerns.

Planned Release Date: Q1 2025.

## Key Features

- Open Standard: Free for everyone to use and modify under the MIT license.

- Super Prompts: A structured approach to controlling AI interactions. More on this below!

- Component-First Architecture: Modular design for reusable workflows.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works with existing web technologies.

## Why MASIL Matters

Building AI apps can be chaotic. MASIL brings order by:

- Simplifying complex AI workflows.

- Making AI interactions more predictable.

- Bridging the gap between natural language and machine precision.

## Super Prompts: MASIL's Special Sauce

Super Prompts let you define precise inputs and outputs for AI interactions, improving reliability and predictability. The MASIL document can be copied and pasted into most AIs, which will understand the structure and act accordingly. These interactions can then be round-tripped back into the MASIL file. You can test out this capability today.

## MASIL: A Two-Part Approach

The MASIL standard has two parts:

1. A strict XML-compliant XSD schema for defining data and workflows.

2. A relaxed schema, not XML, with the ability to address AI with natural language. Authors can use natural language, a structured approach, or both.

## Offloading Processing to JavaScript

MASIL offloads processing from the AI engine to JavaScript, leveraging both technologies' strengths. A simple demonstration of this is the graphing capabilities in the playground on https://glitch.com/edit/#!/masil-playground. The data can be manipulated by AI and pasted into the MASIL file, and JavaScript can do the heavy lifting for graphing or anything else that JavaScript is good at. Why burden AI processing with things best done locally?

## A Playground for Experimentation

I've put two files on Glitch.com: 'index.html' and the MASIL file. You can play with them to see how MASIL works in practice. This is a proof of concept, not a complete demonstration, but it allows you to experiment with a pre-release version of MASIL today.

## The Evolution of MASIL

My year-long journey to arrive at the MASIL standard has a bit of history. A year ago, AI wasn't ready for MASIL, but things have changed! MASIL has gone through several iterations:

1. AI Markdown (aimarkdown.org): My first attempt at structuring AI workflows.

2. AI DataDoc: An intermediate stage in the development. You can read more about AI DataDoc in my Hacker Noon article: [https://hackernoon.com/aidatadoc-chatgpt-web-technologies-one-file-to-rule-them-all-open-source-simple-portable](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://hackernoon.com/aidatadoc-chatgpt-web-technologies-one-file-to-rule-them-all-open-source-simple-portable).

3. MinderAI's MASIL: The current, fully-realized format.

## A Standard You Can Use Today

MASIL is ready to be used now. It's XML-compliant, making it adaptable to various AI systems. While you might need to 'convince' AI that MASIL is a standard, its structure makes it easy to work with.

## The Future of MASIL

Frameworks like Svelte or React could directly employ MASIL, with direct access to AI through APIs. MASIL would be at the core. A full-blown application would not use the copy-and-paste method since there would be direct communication with the AI.

MASIL is a foundational tool in the evolving landscape of AI development. It's a 'frontier standard' that addresses the need for structure and predictability in AI workflows.

I carefully chose the acronym MASIL to be distinctive and memorable. While coincidentally sharing a name with a Korean beauty care brand, MASIL represents a unique standard for AI interaction in the tech world. My vision extends beyond the name—I hope to develop open-source AI applications under the MinderAI.org brand that embody this innovation and make all tasks simpler.

Adopting the MASIL standard by large language models would be a massive step for AI development. Imagine if developers didn't have to explain to AI what MASIL is every time since it would be baked in. Let's make it happen!

## Call to Action

MASIL is an evolving standard, and I welcome your feedback! Check out the pre-release (proof of concept). Experiment with it, and share your thoughts. Let's shape the future of AI development together!
